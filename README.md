## Overview
 
JSVecX is a JavaScript port of the VecX emulator. The emulator was ported from
the original C version as developed by Valavan Manohararajah to JavaScript/HTML5.
This port relies on the HTML5 Canvas element for display and the Web Audio API 
for sound (no flash is required). 

The emulator can be found at the following location:

It is also worth noting that there is nothing illegal about posting the
commercial Vectrex roms, they were made available for non-commercial use in the 90's. 

## Known issues

  * Buggy Sound ~ While the emulator now has sound support, it is a bit 
    quirky. Several games will experience periodic audio issues (Berzerk, 
    Star Trek, Armor Attack). Sound can be toggled on and off by clicking 
    the "speaker" button.
  * Overlays are misaligned ~ (core bug) The vector rendering code of VecX
    doesn't appear to be 100% accurate. As a result, some of the overlays
    are a bit misaligned. In addition, text is also sometimes unreadable.
    I will be looking at the vector rendering code to see if this can be 
    resolved.
